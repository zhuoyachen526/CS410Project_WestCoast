Hope I don't regret this

I can't keep my focus
It's too much to resist

I'm over being under your spell
It keeps blinding me
Was too blind to see, yeah
I'm not the only one that you tell
That I'm the only one

But, my heart keeps telling me the perfect lie
You rip me up with every last goodbye
I don't wanna say forever
It's just another now or never
So heart, don't let me trust these butterflies
I don't trust these butterflies

And trust me I'll give a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like

Do you know I want your love?
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me

Say, ""Boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me""
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead

Hey, hey, until I made my getaway

One, two, three, they gonna run back to me
'Cause I'm the best baby that they never gotta keep
One, two, three, they gonna run back to me
They always wanna come, but they never wanna leave

Ex's and the oh, oh, oh's they haunt me
Like ghosts they want me to make 'em all
They won't let go
Ex's and oh's

I don't think that we could work this out""
Out on the terrace
I don't know if it's fair, but I thought
""How could I let you fall by yourself
While I'm wasted with someone else?""

If we go down, then we go down together
They'll say you could do anything
They'll say that I was clever
If we go down, then we go down together
We'll get away with everything
Let's show them we are better

Let's show them we are better

We were staying in Paris
To get away from your parents
You look so proud standing there, with a frown and a cigarette
Posting pictures of yourself on the internet

And baby, I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that

My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job
Didn't see what's going on, but now I know
I'm better sleeping on my own

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself

Dealing with emotions, that never left
Playing with the hand that we were dealt, in this game

Maybe I'm the sinner, and you're the saint
Gotta stop pretending, what we ain't
Why we pointing fingers, anyway?
When we're the same

Break up, make up
Total waste of time
Can we please make up our minds
And stop acting like we're blind?
'Cause if the water dries up and the moon stops shining
Stars fall, and the world goes blind, boy
You know, I'll be saving my love for you, for you

'Cause you're the best mistake I've ever made
But we hold on, mm, hold on
There's no pot of gold in the rainbows we chase

All of them sweet, azucar, azucar, dale disfruta

But guess what?
I'm never gonna be that girl
Who's living in a Barbie world
Could wake up, and make up, and play dumb
Pretending that I need a boy
Who's gonna treat me like a toy

I know the other girls wanna wear expensive things, like diamond rings
But I don't wanna be the puppet that you're playing on a string
This queen don't need a king

Oh, I don't know what you've been told
But this girl right here's gonna rule the world
Yeah, that's where I'm gonna be because I wanna be
No, I don't wanna sit still, look pretty

You get off on your 9 to 5
Dream of picket fences and trophy wives
But no, I'm never gonna be 'cause I don't wanna be
No, I don't wanna sit still look pretty

Mr. Right could be nice, for one night
But then he wanna take control
And I would rather fly solo
That Snow White
She did it right in her life

But I'm only going to get this one chance (six minutes-, six minutes-)
Something's wrong, I can feel it (six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on!)
Just a feeling I've got, like something's about to happen, but I don't know what
If that means what I think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble
And if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances
You are just what the doc ordered

I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rap-bot

But for me to rap like a computer, it must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
Made a livin' and a killin' off it
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinsky feelin' on his nutsack
I'm an MC still as honest
But as rude and as indecent as all hell
Syllables, skill-a-holic (kill 'em all with)

This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop
You don't really wanna get into a pissin' match
With this rappity brat, packin' a MAC in the back of the Ac'
Backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack
And at the exact same time, I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicin' that
I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half

Only realized it was ironic, I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs
Feel my wrath of attack
Rappers are havin' a rough time period, here's a maxi pad
It's actually disastrously bad for the wack
While I'm masterfully constructing this masterpièce

'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
Let me show you maintainin' this shit ain't that hard, that hard
Everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like Ι have got

Well, to be truthful the blueprint's
Simply rage and youthful exuberance
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
Hit the Earth like an asteroid
Did nothing but shoot for the Moon since (pew!)
MCs get taken to school with this music
'Cause I use it as a vehicle to ""Bus the rhyme""
Now I lead a new school full of students

Me? I'm a product of Rakim
Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N.W.A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren
Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim
Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position
To meet Run-D.M.C., induct them
Into the motherfuckin' Rock and Roll Hall of Fame

Even though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame

High off her love, drunk from her hate
It's like I'm huffin' paint, and I love her the more I suffer, I suffocate
And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates me
She f- hates me, and I love it

""No, you ain't, come back""
We're running right back, here we go again
It's so insane 'cause when it's going good, it's going great
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
But when it's bad, it's awful
I feel so ashamed, I snapped, ""Who's that dude?""
I don't even know his name
I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again

I'm just so fucking depressed, I just can seem to get out this slump
If I could just get over this hump but I need something to pull me out this dump
I took my bruises, took my lumps fell down and I got right back up
But I need that spark to get psyched back up in order for me to pick the mic back up
I don't know how or why or when I ended up in this position I'm in
I'm starting to feel distant again so I decided just to pick this pen
Up and try to make an attempt to vent but I just can't admit
Or come to grips with the fact that I may be done with rap ineed a new outlet
I know some shit's so hard to swallow
And I just can't sit back and wallow
In my own sorrow but I know one fact, I'll be one tough act to follow
One tough act to follow
I'll be one tough act to follow
Here today, gone tomorrow
But you have to walk a thousand miles

In my shoes, just to see
What it's like, to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's mind
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh oh
They can all get fucked just stay true to you so oh oh

The moment you've all been waiting for
In this corner, weighing 175 pounds
With a record of 17 rapes, 400 assaults, and four murders
The undisputed, most diabolical villain in the world
Slim Shady!

So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
O-oh, o-oh, bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe
Got one ridin' shotgun and no, not one of 'em got clothes

Now, where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of 'em
And there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kickin' up dust
It's on 'til the break of dawn
And we're starting this party from dusk

(Okay, let's go)
Back with Andre the Giant, Mr. Elephant Tusk
Fix your musk, you'll be just another one bit the dust
Just one of my mother's sons who got thrown under the bus
Kiss my butt, lick from unda cheese from under my nuts

It disgusts me to see the game the way that it looks
It's a must, I redeem my name and haters get mushed
Bitches lust, man, they love me when I lay in the cut
Fisticuffs, the lady give her eighty-some paper cuts

Now picture us; it's ridiculous, you curse at the thought
'Cause when I spit the verse the shit gets worse than Worcestershire sauce
If I could fit the words, it's picture perfect, works every time
Every verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes

It's elementary, the elephants have entered the room
I venture to say we're the center of attention, it's true
Not to mention back with a vengeance, so hence the signal
Of the bat symbol, the platinum trio's back on you hoes

频繁暴露了自欺欺人者
越掩饰越深刻
你说我说听说
忍着言不由衷的段落
我反正决定自己难过
我想摸你的头发
只是简单的试探啊
我想给你个拥抱
像以前一样可以吗
你退半步的动作认真的吗
小小的动作伤害还那么大
我只能扮演个绅士
才能和你说说话
我能送你回家吗

I'd spend 10,000 hours and 10,000 more
Oh, if that's what it takes to learn that sweet heart of yours
And I might never get there, but I'm gonna try
If it's 10,000 hours or the rest of my life
I'm gonna love you (ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)

I feel like I've been lacking, crying too many tears
Everyone seemed to say, it was so great
But did I miss out? Was it a huge mistake?

I can't help the fact I like to be alone
It might sound kinda sad, but that's just what I seem to know
I tend to handle things usually by myself
And I can't ever seem to try and ask for help

I'm sitting here, crying in my prom dress
I'd be the Prom Queen if crying was a contest
Make-up is running down, feelings are all around
How did I get here? I need to know
I guess I maybe had a couple expectations
Thought I'd get to them, but no I didn't
I guess I thought that prom was gonna be fun

I hear it in your voice
You're smoking with your boys
I touch my phone as if it's your face
I didn't choose this town
I dream of getting out
There's just one who could make me stay
All my days

From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
I waited ages to see you there
I search the party of better bodies
Just to learn that you never cared

I'm unglued - thanks to you

And it's like snow at the beach
Weird but fuckin' beautiful
Flying in a dream
Stars by the pocketful

Tonight
Feels impossible

She understand I can't take her everywhere a n- going
I been in the field like the children of the corn

I can hear your tears when they drop over the phone
Get mad at yourself 'cause you can't leave me alone
Gossip, bein' messy, that ain't what we doing (world was ending)

Travel around the world (would you cry or would you try to get me?)
Over the phone, dropping tears (tell me now, I want you to be clear, yeah)
I get more vulnerable when I do pills (tell me now, I need you to be clear, yeah)

Don't leave me hanging in a city so dead
Held up so high on such a breakable thread

You were all the things I thought I knew
And I thought we could be

You were everything, everything that I wanted
We were meant to be, supposed to be, but we lost it
All of the memories so close to me just fade away
All this time you were pretending
So much for my happy ending

A U-Haul truck in the driveway

We let you sit behind the wheel

Goodbye, goodbye
Now it's just me and my little guy
And the house felt so big, and I felt so small

Losing your mind baby
Can't be sure, time's wasting

Nice to meet you, I'm sorry
I'm just here to do my job
Nice to meet you, no running
Please don't fear me, I'm just karma

Let me dance for you, I'm sorry
You'll wanna love me strong, then I'm gone
This feeling's just for you and your wrongs

All the things you said we wouldn't be (be, be, be)

So be it
It's been a hard time adjusting
So be it
Instead of lettin' me know, you kept secrets
But if I cut you this deep, you'd be in pieces
If that's how you really feel, then so be it

I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love
So come give me a hug, if you into getting rubbed

When I pull out up front, you see the Benz on dubs
When I roll 20 deep, it's 20 knives in the club
Niggas heard I fuck with Dre, now they wanna show me love
When you sell like Eminem, and the hoes they wanna fuck
But, homie, ain't nothing change hoes down, G's up
I see Xzibit in the cut, that nigga roll that weed up
If you watch how I move, you'll mistake me for a playa or pimp
Been hit wit' a few shells, but I don't walk wit' a limp (I'm ight)

(I can't wake up) wake me up inside
(Save me) call my name and save me from the dark
(Wake me up) bid my blood to run
(I can't wake up) before I come undone
(Save me) save me from the nothing I've become

Now that I know what I'm without, you can't just leave me
Breathe into me and make me real
Bring (bring) me (me) to life

People livin' like they ain't got no mamas
I think the whole world's addicted to the drama
Only attracted to things that'll bring you trauma

Overseas, yeah, we tryna stop terrorism
But we still got terrorists here livin'
In the USA, the big CIA
The Bloods and The Crips and the KKK

But if you only have love for your own race
Then you only leave space to discriminate
And to discriminate only generates hate
And when you hate, then you're bound to get irate, yeah

Madness is what you demonstrate
And that's exactly how anger works and operates
Man, you gotta have love just to set it straight
Take control of your mind and meditate
Let your soul gravitate to the love, y'all, y'all

People killin', people dyin'
Children hurt, hear them cryin'
Can you practice what you preach
Or would you turn the other cheek?

Father, Father, Father, help us
Send some guidance from above
'Cause people got me, got me questionin'
Where is the love (love)

Where is the love? (The love)
Where is the love? (The love)
Where is the love, the love, the love?

It just ain't the same, old ways have changed
New days are strange, is the world insane?
If love and peace are so strong

Only you can let it in
No one else, no one else
Can speak the words on your lips
Drench yourself in words unspoken
Live your life with arms wide open
Today is where your book begins
The rest is still unwritten, yeah

I break tradition
Sometimes my tries, are outside the lines yeah, yeah
We've been conditioned to not make mistakes
But I can't live that way oh, oh

Last Friday night
Yeah, we danced on tabletops, and we took too many shots
Think we kissed, but I forgot last Friday night
Yeah, we maxed our credit cards and got kicked out of the bar
So we hit the boulevard last Friday night
We went streaking in the park, skinny-dipping in the dark
Then had a ménage à trois last Friday night

And her scars or how she got them

As the telling signs of age rain down
A single tear is dropping
Through the valleys of an aging face
That this world has forgotten

There is no reconciliation
That will put me in my place
And there is no time like the present
To drink these draining seconds

But seldom do these words ring true
When I'm constantly failing you
Walls that we just can't break through
Until we disappear

So tell me now
If this ain't love then how do we get out?

Can't you see? I'm at your feet

Whenever, wherever
We're meant to be together
I'll be there, and you'll be near
And that's the deal, my dear
There over, hereunder
You'll never have to wonder
We can always play by ear
But that's the deal, my dear

And I've missed your ginger hair

And I can't sweep you off of your feet

Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?

And, darling, I will
Be loving you 'til we're 70

And, baby, my heart
Could still fall as hard at 23

And I'm thinking 'bout how

People fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Well, me, I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am

So, honey, now

When you hurt under the surface
Like troubled water running cold
Well, time can heal, but this won't

So, before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make your heart beat better?
If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make it all stop hurting?

Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night

Without granting innocence

She wants from her time
And when she wakes up
And makes up her mind

She'll see I'm not so tough
Just because
I'm in love with an uptown girl
You know I've seen her in her uptown world
She's getting tired of her high-class toys
And all her presents from her uptown boys

Get a little outta line

I only wanna have a good time

Is the prerogative to have a little fun and

You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Like resignation to the end, always the end
So when we found that we could not make sense
Well, you said that we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was glad it was over

But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love

To count the freckles on your body
Never could imagine there were only
Ten million ways to love somebody

Le-do-lo-le-lo-le, le-do-lo-le-lo-le
Can't you see? I'm at your feet

Whenever, wherever
We're meant to be together
I'll be there, and you'll be near
And that's the deal, my dear
There over, hereunder
You'll never have to wonder
We can always play by ear
But that's the deal, my dear
