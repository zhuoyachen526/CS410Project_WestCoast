So many words for the broken heart
It's hard to see in a crimson love
So hard to breathe
Walk with me, and maybe
Nights of light so soon become
Wild and free, I could feel the sun
Your every wish will be done
They tell me

Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with?
Tell me why I can't be there where you are
There's something missing in my heart

Nowhere to hide when I'm getting you close

Nothing I can see but you when you dance, dance, dance
Feeling good, good, creeping up on you
So just dance, dance, dance, come on

So beat it, just beat it

You better run, you better do what you can
Don't wanna see no blood, don't be a macho man
You wanna be tough, better do what you can
So beat it, but you wanna be bad

Just beat it (beat it), beat it (beat it)

Showin' how funky and strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right

You were my earth
But you didn't know all the ways I loved you, no
So you took a chance
And made other plans
But I bet you didn't think that they would come crashing down, no

You don't have to say what you did
I already know, I found out from him
Now there's just no chance for you and me
There'll never be
And don't it make you sad about it

You told me you loved me
Why did you leave me all alone
Now you tell me you need me
When you call me on the phone
Girl I refuse
You must have me confused
With some other guy
The bridges were burned
Now it's your turn
To cry

Cry me a river
Cry me a river
Cry me a river
Cry me a river

Know that they say
That some things are better left unsaid
It wasn't like you only talked to him and you know it
(Don't act like you don't know it)

All of these things people told me
Keep messing with my head
(Messing with my head)
Should've picked honesty
Then you may not have blown it

Jay, Rain Man is back
With Little Miss Sunshine, Rihanna, where you at?

You have my heart
And we'll never be worlds apart
Maybe in magazines
But you'll still be my star
Baby, 'cause in the dark
You can't see shiny cars
And that's when you need me there
With you, I'll always share
Because

When the sun shine, we shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out to the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other

And I can't remember where or when or how
And I banished every memory you and I had ever made

But when you touch me like this
And you hold me like that
I just have to admit
That it's all coming back to me
When I touch you like this
And I hold you like that
It's so hard to believe but
It's all coming back to me
It's all coming back
It's all coming back to me now
There were moments of gold
And there were flashes of light
There were things I'd never do again
But then they'd always seemed right
There were nights of endless pleasure
It was more than any laws allow

Baby, baby
If I kiss you like this
And if you whisper like that
It was lost long ago
But it's all coming back to me
If you want me like this
And if you need me like that
It was dead long ago

Of lovers sleeping tight
Are rolling by like thunder now
As I look in your eyes

I hold on to your whole body
And feel each move you make
Your voice is warm and tender
A love that I could not forsake

'Cause I'm your lady
And you are my man
Whenever you reach for me
I'll do all that I can

Lost is how I'm feeling lying in your arms
When the world outside's too much to take
That all ends when I'm with you

Even though there may be times
It seems I'm far away

They drive their shiny Datsuns and Buicks
Back to the phone company, the record store too
Well, they're nothing like Billy and me

'Cause all I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one

Put on a poncho, played for mosquitoes
And drank 'til I was thirsty again

We went searchin'
Through thrift store jungles
Found Geronimo's rifle, Marilyn's shampoo
And Benny Goodman's corset and pen

Well, okay, I made this up
I promised you I'd never give up

If it makes you happy
It can't be that bad
If it makes you happy
Then why the hell are you so sad?

A cross between a zombie apocalypse and B-Bobby, ""The

Shady's in this bitch, I'm posse'd up
Consider it to cross me a costly mistake
If they sleepin' on me, the hoes better get insomnia, ADHD, Hydroxycut

Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet
Fire, Godzilla, fire, monster

I'm just a product of Slick Rick, at Onyx, told 'em lick the balls
Had 'em just appalled at so many things that pissed 'em off
It's impossible to list 'em all
And in the midst of all this
I'm in a mental hospital with a crystal ball
Tryna see, will I still be like this tomorrow?
Risperdal, voices whisper

My fist is balled back up against the wall, pencil drawn
This is just the song to go ballistic on
You just pulled a pistol on the guy with the missile launcher
I'm just a Loch Ness, the mythological

Happy nation living in a happy nation
Where the people understand
And dream of perfect man
Situation leading to sweet salvation
For the people, for the good
For mankind brotherhood
(We're traveling in time)

Ideas by man and only that will last
And over time we've learned from the past
That no man's fit to rule the world alone
A man will die, but not his ideas

In the name of love
Or play it safe
For a while that was easy
And if living for myself
Is what I'm guilty of
Go on and sentence me
I'll still be free

It's my turn
To see what I can see
I hope you'll understand
This time's just for me

Because it's my turn
With no apologies
I've given up the truth
To those I've tried to please

But now it's my turn
If I don't have all the answers
At least I know I'll take my share of chances
Ain't no use of holding on
When nothing stays the same

So I'll let it rain

Have a drink, have a drive
Go out and see what you can find

If her daddy's poor, just do what you feel
Speed along the lane, do a ton or a ton and twenty-five
When the sun goes down
You can make it, make it good in a lay-by

We're not grey people, we're not dirty, we're not mean
We love everybody, but we do as we please

We're always happy, life's for living
Yeah, that's our philosophy

Sing along with us
Dee-dee-dee, dee-dee

It's more the way that you mean it

Has all been meant for you

On a farm way back up in the woods
I was so ragged the folks used to call me Patches
Papa used to tease me about it 'Course deep down inside
He was hurt 'cause he'd done all he could

My papa was a great old man
I can see him with a shovel in his hand
See, education he never had
He did wonders when the times got bad
The little money from the crops he raised
Barely paid the bills we made
Oh life had kicked him down to the ground
When he tried to get up life would kick him back down
One day papa called me to his dyin' bed
Put his hands on my shoulders And in tears he said
He said ""Patches, I'm depending on you son,
To pull the family through,
My son, it's all left up to you""

Two days later papa passed away
And I became a man that day

She was livin to be givin there's a lot that she gave
There's not a slave, in this day and age
I'm proud to be

Don't worry bout what color I am
Because I'll show you how ill, this man can act
It could never be fiction cause it is all fact
And if you get in my way, I will not turn back

I dreamed I was in a Hollywood movie
And that I was the star of the movie
This really blew my mind

Should be the star behind a Hollywood movie, hmm

I stood high by the mountain tops

Spot in the Caribbean by providence, impoverished, in squalor
Grow up to be a hero and a scholar?

The ten-dollar Founding Father without a father
Got a lot farther by working a lot harder
By being a lot smarter, by being a self-starter
By 14, they placed him in charge of a trading charter

And every day while slaves were being slaughtered and carted
Away across the waves, he struggled and kept his guard up
Inside, he was longing for something to be a part of
The brother was ready to beg, steal, borrow, or barter

Then a hurricane came, and devastation reigned
Our man saw his future drip, dripping down the drain
Put a pencil to his temple, connected it to his brain
And he wrote his first refrain, a testament to his pain

Well, the word got around, they said, ""This kid is insane, man""
Took up a collection just to send him to the mainland
""Get your education, don't forget from whence you came, and
The world's gonna know your name, what's your name, man?""

The price of my love's not a price that you're willing to pay
You cry
In your tea, which you hurl in the sea when you see me go by

Why so sad?
Remember, we made an arrangement when you went away
Now, you're making me mad
Remember, despite our estrangement, I'm your man

You'll be back, soon, you'll see
You'll remember you belong to me

You'll remember that I served you well
Oceans rise, empires fall
We have seen each other through it all

For just a millisecond?

The venerated Virginian veteran whose men are all
Lining up, to put me up on a pedestal
Writin' letters to relatives
Embellishin' my elegance and eloquence
But the elephant is in the room
The truth is in ya face when ya hear the British cannons go

Boom!

Any hope of success is fleeting
How can I keep leading when the people I'm
Leading keep retreating?
We put a stop to the bleeding as the British take Brooklyn
Knight takes rook, but look

We are outgunned (What?)

I guess I'm gonna fin'ly have to listen to you

Do whatever it takes to get my plan on the Congress floor
Now, Madison and Jefferson are merciless
Well, hate the sin, love the sinner
Hamilton!
I'm sorry Burr, I've gotta go
But-
Decisions are happening over dinner

Two Virginians and an immigrant walk into a room
Diametric'ly opposed, foes
They emerge with a compromise
Having opened doors that were previously closed, bros
The immigrant emerges with unprecedented financial power
A system he can shape however he wants
The Virginians emerge with the nation's capital
And here's the pi√®ce de r√©sistance:

No one else was in the room where it happened
The room where it happened
The room where it happened
No one else was in the room where it happened
The room where it happened
The room where it happened

No one really knows how the game is played
The art of the trade
How the sausage gets made
We just assume that it happens
But no one else is in the room where it happens

Alexander was on Washington's doorstep one day
In distress 'n disarray

Alexander said:
""I've nowhere else to turn!""
And basic'ly begged me to join the fray

We smack each other in the press, and we don't print retractions

I get no satisfaction witnessing his fits of passion
The way he primps and preens and dresses like the pits of fashion
Our poorest citizens, our farmers, live ration to ration
As Wall Street robs 'em blind in search of chips to cash in

This prick is asking for someone to bring him to task
Somebody give me some dirt on his vacuous mask
So we can, at last, unmask him
I'll pull the trigger on him, someone load the gun and cock it
While we were all watching, he got Washington in his pocket

Almost a thousand dollars paid in different amounts
To a Mr. James Reynolds way back in 1791

You are uniquely situated by virtue of your position
Though virtue is not a word I'd apply to this situation
To seek financial gain, you stray from your sacred mission
And the evidence suggests you engaged in speculation
An immigrant embezzling our government funds

So now I'm facing
Aaron Burr

He's very attractive in the North, New Yorkers like his chances
He's not very forthcoming on any particular stances
Ask him a question, it glances off, he obfuscates, he dances
And they say I'm a Francophile, at least they know I know where France is!

Thomas that's the problem, see, they see Burr as a less extreme you (ha!)
You need to change course, a key endorsement might redeem you
Who did you have in mind?
Don't laugh
Who is it?
You used to work on the same staff
What

It might be nice, it might be nice
To get Hamilton on your side
It might be nice, it might be nice
To get Hamilton on your side

Talk less (Burr!)
Smile more (Burr!)
Don't let 'em know what you're against or what you're for (Burr!)
Shake hands with him (Burr!)
Charm her (Burr!)
It's 1800, ladies, tell your husbands

I am who I'm meant to be, this is me
Look out 'cause here I come
And I'm marching on to the beat I drum
I'm not scared to be seen
I make no apologies, this is me

Oh oh oh oh (Oh oh oh oh)

Hugh Jackman,5F1aoppMtU3OMiltO8ymJ2,From Now On,3IkWmgGsXbsafrunwPojXO,"I saw the sun begin to dim
And felt that winter wind blow cold
A man learns who is there for him
When the glitter fades and the walls won't hold

'Cause from then, rubble
What remains
Can only be what's true
If all was lost
There's more I gained
'Cause it led me back
To you

From now on
These eyes will not be blinded by the lights
From now on
What's waited 'til tomorrow starts tonight
Tonight

Let this promise in me start
Like an anthem in my heart
From now on
From now on

I drank champagne with kings and queens
The politicians praised my name
But those are someone else's dreams
The pitfalls of the man I became

For years and years
I chased their cheers
The crazy speed of always needing more
But when I stop

Once I had a love and it was a gas
Soon turned out had a heart of glass
Seemed like the real thing, only to find
Mucho mistrust, love's gone behind

Once I had a love and it was divine
Soon turned out I was looking my mind
It seemed like the real thing but I was so blind
Mucho mistrust love's gone behind

In between
What I find is pleasing and I'm feeling fine
Love is so confusing there's no peace of mind
If I fear I'm loosing you it's just no good

Tell me about it, girl
What is this story, babe
That gift can't be taken

Why Me
You think that I'm the one for you
I was born with a duffel on my back
Can we lighten up

Why Me
I barely do the laundry
And I hate to wake up early
Can we lighten up, girl

Tell me...
Why this love, why this love
Why this love, are you sure that I'm the one
Why this love, that your heart is longing for
Why this love
But if you put your head upon my shoulder
I'm not the kind of man who's gonna walk away
