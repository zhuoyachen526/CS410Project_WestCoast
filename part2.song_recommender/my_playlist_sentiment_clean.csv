It's funny how things never change in this old town
So far from the stars

And I want to tell you everything
The words I never got to say the first time around
And I remember everything
From when we were the children playing in this fairground
Wish I was there with you now

If the whole world was watching I'd still dance with you
Drive highways and byways to be there with you
Over and over the only truth
Everything comes back to you

It was a big-big world, but we thought we were bigger
Pushing each other to the limits, we were learning quicker
By 11, smoking herb and drinking burning liquor
Never rich, so we were out to make that steady figure

Once, I was 11 years old, my daddy told me
""Go get yourself a wife, or you'll be lonely""
Once, I was 11 years old

I always had that dream like my daddy before me
So I started writing songs, I started writing stories
Something about the glory just always seemed to bore me
'Cause only those I really love will ever really know me

Before the morning sun, when life was lonely

As he goes left, and you stay right
Between the lines of fear and blame

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

Let him know that you know best

Try to slip past his defense
Without granting innocence

Lay down a list of what is wrong

She was looking kind of dumb
With her finger and her thumb
In the shape of an ""L"" on her forehead

Well, the years start coming
And they don't stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart, but your head gets dumb

So much to do, so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
You'll never know if you don't go
You'll never shine if you don't glow

Hey now, you're an all star
Get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star
Get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold

It's a cool place and they say it gets colder
You're bundled up now, wait 'til you get older

She asked me what does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?
Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you want to drink on?
She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar

We got too many runaways eating up the night
Marconi plays the mambo, listen to the radio
Don't you remember?
We built this city
We built this city on rock and roll
We built this city

Built this city
We built this city on rock and roll
Someone's always playing corporation games
Who cares, they're always changing corporation names
We just want to dance here, someone stole the stage

Look what I have done now
Dialling up the numbers on you

I'm hoping that my love will keep you up tonight

When she asks for something boy she means it

See, I don't know 'bout y'all, but I know about us and, uh
It's the only way we know how to rock
I don't know 'bout y'all, but I know about us and, uh
It's the only way we know how to rock
Do you remember, girl?
I was the one who gave you your first kiss
'Cause I remember, girl
I was the one who said, ""Put your lips like this""
Even before all the fame
And people screaming your name
Girl, I was there when you were my baby
It started when we were younger, you were mine (my boo)
Now another brother's taken over, but it's still in your eyes (my boo)
Even though we used to argue, it's alright (my boo)

But I've all but just forgotten
What the colour of her eyes were
And her scars or how she got them

As the telling signs of age rain down
A single tear is dropping
Through the valleys of an aging face
That this world has forgotten

There is no reconciliation
That will put me in my place
And there is no time like the present
To drink these draining seconds

But seldom do these words ring true
When I'm constantly failing you
Walls that we just can't break through
Until we disappear

So tell me now
If this ain't love then how do we get out?
'Cause I don't know

That's when she said
""I don't hate you boy
I just want to save you

She'd turn the rain to a rainbow when I was living in the blue

Perfect don't mean that it's working, so what can I do? (Ooh)

When you're out of sight in my mind

'Cause sometimes I look in her eyes, and that's where I find a glimpse of us
And I try to fall for her touch, but I'm thinking of the way it was
Said, ""I'm fine"" and said, ""I moved on""
I'm only here passing time in her arms

Just a young gun with a quick fuse

I was dreaming of bigger things, and
Wanna leave my old life behind

Fit the box, fit the mold
Have a seat in the foyer, take a number

Bang bang, pop off like a long gun

If you a lame nigga, you ain't making no noise
Get faded, turn up with the big boys
Live fast, die young that's my choice
Get money, get money like an invoice
We can mob all in the whip (make the money)
Make the money make a grip (I be stuntin')
I be stuntin' with my clique (gettin' faded)
Getting faded 'til we trip (oh)

Man, I love to get on

When the drink be too strong
When the tree be way too strong
Get-get-get faded, turn up, bruh
Pour it on up 'til I can't even think no more
Get-get-get ratchet, go dumb then go more dumb then
We can keep it lit, let's roll

We'd make out in your Mustang to Radiohead
And on my 18th birthday we got matching tattoos
Used to steal your parents' liquor and climb to the roof
Talk about our future like we had a clue
Never planned that one day I'd be losing you

In another life
I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises
Be us against the world
In another life
I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were
The one that got away
The one that got away

I was June and you were my Johnny Cash
Never one without the other, we made a pact
Sometimes when I miss you I put those records on (whoa)

Strung out, a little bit hazy
Hand over heart, I'm praying
That I'm gonna make it out alive

The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all

Save your advice, 'cause I won't hear
You might be right, but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up

And I don't know how to stop
Or slow it down

Hey

And I can't stay
Just let me hold you for a little longer now

Take a piece of my heart
And make it all your own
So when we are apart
You'll never be alone

Move on

You watch me bleed until I can't breathe, shaking
Falling onto my knees

Begging you to come help

'Cause I feel like I'm always dreamin'

Sometimes I tend to lose myself when I'm out here on my own
I never seem to get it right, but I guess that's how it goes
Ever since you came around, can't nobody hold me down
You showed me how to find myself when I needed it the most

I been up all night, no sleep

But I'm only going to get this one chance (six minutes-, six minutes-)
Something's wrong, I can feel it (six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on!)
Just a feeling I've got, like something's about to happen, but I don't know what
If that means what I think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble
And if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances
You are just what the doc ordered

I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rap-bot

But for me to rap like a computer, it must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
Made a livin' and a killin' off it
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinsky feelin' on his nutsack
I'm an MC still as honest
But as rude and as indecent as all hell
Syllables, skill-a-holic (kill 'em all with)

This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop
You don't really wanna get into a pissin' match
With this rappity brat, packin' a MAC in the back of the Ac'
Backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack
And at the exact same time, I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicin' that
I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half

Only realized it was ironic, I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs
Feel my wrath of attack
Rappers are havin' a rough time period, here's a maxi pad
It's actually disastrously bad for the wack
While I'm masterfully constructing this masterpièce

'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
Let me show you maintainin' this shit ain't that hard, that hard
Everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like Ι have got

Well, to be truthful the blueprint's
Simply rage and youthful exuberance
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
Hit the Earth like an asteroid
Did nothing but shoot for the Moon since (pew!)
MCs get taken to school with this music
'Cause I use it as a vehicle to ""Bus the rhyme""
Now I lead a new school full of students

Me? I'm a product of Rakim
Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N.W.A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren
Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim
Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position
To meet Run-D.M.C., induct them
Into the motherfuckin' Rock and Roll Hall of Fame

Even though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame

Up and try to make an attempt to vent but I just can't admit

One tough act to follow
I'll be one tough act to follow

But you have to walk a thousand miles

In my shoes, just to see
What it's like, to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's mind
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes

The undisputed, most diabolical villain in the world

So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto

Got one ridin' shotgun and no, not one of 'em got clothes

And there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kickin' up dust
It's on 'til the break of dawn
And we're starting this party from dusk

Back with Andre the Giant, Mr. Elephant Tusk
Fix your musk, you'll be just another one bit the dust
Just one of my mother's sons who got thrown under the bus
Kiss my butt, lick from unda cheese from under my nuts

It disgusts me to see the game the way that it looks
It's a must, I redeem my name and haters get mushed
Bitches lust, man, they love me when I lay in the cut
Fisticuffs, the lady give her eighty-some paper cuts

Now picture us; it's ridiculous, you curse at the thought
'Cause when I spit the verse the shit gets worse than Worcestershire sauce
If I could fit the words, it's picture perfect, works every time
Every verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes

It's elementary, the elephants have entered the room
I venture to say we're the center of attention, it's true
Not to mention back with a vengeance, so hence the signal
Of the bat symbol, the platinum trio's back on you hoes

Everyone else, but you, ooh

Baby, you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground, it ain't hard to tell
You don't know, oh-oh
You don't know you're beautiful

If only you saw what I can see
You'll understand why I want you so desperately
Right now I'm lookin' at you, and I can't believe

You don't know, oh-oh
You don't know you're beautiful, oh, oh-oh
That's what makes you beautiful

So c-come on, you got it wrong

Don't you got a girl that can make you feel nice?
It's a dead sign

You see me as your lifeline
Other boys and girls never really made you feel right
And you can't explain why I'm always running your mind
Don't you see the answer's right in front of your eyes?

You like me, oh, obviously
So why you trying to leave when you know that I'm the king?
(You'll see)
'Cause I'm supreme
(Choose me)
Other lovers give you no luck
'Cause I'm the only one that has made you fall in love
(You'll see)
So just shut up

Got to be a lot that's wrong with you
To want to be with me

We're fighting 'til someone's calling the cops
But you never blame it on me
You're so annoying
Four in the morning, you're changing the locks
How could you do this to me? (Oh)

If you're leaving, baby, let me down slowly

And I can't give you up
No I know you're no good for me
You're no good for me

I fell in love with the Devil
And now I'm in trouble
I fell in love with the Devil
I'm underneath his spell (Oh)
Someone send me an angel
To lend me a halo
I fell in love with the Devil
Please save me from this hell (Oh)

感情是用來瀏覽 還是用來珍藏
好讓日子天天都過得難忘

熬過了多久患難 濕了多少眼眶
才能知道傷感是愛的遺產
流浪幾張雙人床 換過幾次信仰
才讓戒指義無反顧地交換

把一個人的溫暖 轉移到另一個的胸膛
讓上次犯的錯反省出夢想
每個人都是這樣 享受過提心吊膽
才拒絕做愛情待罪的羔羊

回憶是捉不到的月光握緊就變黑暗
等虛假的背影消失於晴朗
陽光在身上流轉 等所有業障被原諒

不是不能面對 又不是十八歲
愛過你的年歲 心裡至少真的不後悔
也許會不捨會落淚 但得不到也許才珍貴

是否我就能夠 對你笑著揮手

愛可以不問對錯 至少要喜悅感動
如果他總為別人撐傘 妳何苦非為他等在雨中

泡咖啡讓妳暖手 想擋擋妳心口裡的風
妳卻想上街走走 吹吹冷風會清醒的多
妳說妳不怕分手 只有點遺憾難過
情人節就要來了 剩自己一個
其實愛對了人 情人節每天都過
