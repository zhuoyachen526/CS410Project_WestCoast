So many words for the broken heart
It's hard to see in a crimson love
So hard to breathe
Walk with me, and maybe
Nights of light so soon become
Wild and free, I could feel the sun
Your every wish will be done
They tell me

Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with?
Tell me why I can't be there where you are
There's something missing in my heart

Wondering if I dodged a bullet or just lost the love of my life, oh

I think they're okay
If they don't give me proper credit
I just walk away

They can beg and they can plead
But they can't see the light, that's right
'Cause the boy with the cold hard cash
Is always Mister Right

'Cause we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl

Some boys romance, some boys slow dance
That's alright with me
If they can't raise my interest then I
Have to let them be

Some boys try and some boys lie but
I don't let them play, no way
Only boys that save their pennies
Make my rainy day

I was introduced and we both started grooving

Who waited for the worst, 'cause the best lived 'cross town
Who never planned on having, so didn't
Why me, huh?

Everything's gonna be alright now (alright)

Some get a little and some get none
Some catch a bad one and some leave the job half done
I was one who never had and always mad
Never knew my dad, motherfuck the fag

Well, anyway, I did pickups, lift-and-click-ups
Seen many stick-ups, 'cause niggas had the trigger hiccups
I couldn't get a job, nappy hair was not allowed
My mother couldn't afford us all, she had to throw me out

I walked the strip with just a clip, who want a hit?
They got 'em quick, I had to eat, this money's good as spent
I threw in braids, I wasn't paid enough
I kept 'em long 'cause I couldn't afford a haircut

I got laughed at, I got chumped, I got dissed
I got upset, I got a TEC and a banana clip
Was down to throw the lead to any telling tackhead

No matter how far

It's like a seed that only needs the thought of you to grow
So if you feel the need for company
Please, my darling, let it be me

I may not be able to express
The depth of the love I feel for you
But a writer put it very nicely
When he was away from the one he loved
He sat down and wrote these words

No wind (no wind)

Can stop me, babe

I can see him with a shovel in his hand
See, education he never had
He did wonders when the times got bad
The little money from the crops he raised
Barely paid the bills we made
Oh life had kicked him down to the ground
When he tried to get up life would kick him back down
One day papa called me to his dyin' bed
Put his hands on my shoulders And in tears he said
He said ""Patches, I'm depending on you son,
To pull the family through,
My son, it's all left up to you""

This really blew my mind

And a Scotsman, dropped in the middle of a forgotten
Spot in the Caribbean by providence, impoverished, in squalor
Grow up to be a hero and a scholar?

The ten-dollar Founding Father without a father
Got a lot farther by working a lot harder
By being a lot smarter, by being a self-starter
By 14, they placed him in charge of a trading charter

And every day while slaves were being slaughtered and carted
Away across the waves, he struggled and kept his guard up
Inside, he was longing for something to be a part of
The brother was ready to beg, steal, borrow, or barter

Then a hurricane came, and devastation reigned
Our man saw his future drip, dripping down the drain
Put a pencil to his temple, connected it to his brain
And he wrote his first refrain, a testament to his pain

Well, the word got around, they said, ""This kid is insane, man""
Took up a collection just to send him to the mainland
""Get your education, don't forget from whence you came, and
The world's gonna know your name, what's your name, man?""

I have never been the same

And when you said ""Hi""

Where's my son?
Mr. Hamilton, come in, they brought him in a half an hour ago
He lost a lot of blood on the way over
Is he alive?

Yes, but you have to understand
The bullet entered just above his hip and
Lodged in his right arm

Can I see him please?

I'm doing everything I can, but the wound was
Already infected when he arrived

Philip

I did exactly as you said, Pa
I held my head up high

There are moments that the words don't reach.
There is suffering too terrible to name.
You hold your child as tight as you can
And push away the unimaginable.
The moments when you're in so deep,
It feels easier to just swim down.
ANGELICA/ENSEMBLE
The Hamiltons move uptown
And learn to live with the unimaginable.
HAMILTON
I spend hours in the garden.
I walk alone to the store,
And it's quiet uptown.
I never liked the quiet before.
I take the children to church on Sunday,
A sign of the cross at the door,
And I pray.
That never used to happen before.
ANGELICA AND WOMEN
If you see him in the street, walking by
Himself, talking to himself,
Have pity.

Philip, you would like it uptown.
It's quiet uptown.

Can we get back to politics?
Please?

Yo
Ev'ry action has its equal, opposite reaction
John Adams shat the bed, I love the guy, but he's in traction
Poor Alexander Hamilton, he is missing in action
So now I'm facing
Aaron Burr
With his own faction

He's very attractive in the North, New Yorkers like his chances
He's not very forthcoming on any particular stances
Ask him a question, it glances off, he obfuscates, he dances
And they say I'm a Francophile, at least they know I know where France is!

Thomas that's the problem, see, they see Burr as a less extreme you (ha!)
You need to change course, a key endorsement might redeem you
Who did you have in mind?
Don't laugh
Who is it?
You used to work on the same staff
What

It might be nice, it might be nice
To get Hamilton on your side
It might be nice, it might be nice
To get Hamilton on your side

Talk less (Burr!)
Smile more (Burr!)
Don't let 'em know what you're against or what you're for (Burr!)
Shake hands with him (Burr!)
Charm her (Burr!)
It's 1800, ladies, tell your husbands
Vote for Burr (Burr!)

I don't like Adams
Well, he's gonna lose, that's just defeatist
And Jefferson?
In love with France!
Yeah, he's so elitist!
I like that Aaron Burr!

An arrogant immigrant, orphan
Bastard, whoreson
Somehow endorse Thomas Jefferson, his enemy
A man he's despised since the beginning
Just to keep me from winning?

I wanna be in the room where it happens
The room where it happens, the room where it happens
You've kept me from the room where it happens
For the last time

Dear Alexander
I am slow to anger
But I toe the line
As I reckon with the effects of your life on mine
I look back on where I failed
And in every place I checked
The only common thread has been your disrespect

Now you call me amoral

There are ten things you need to know (number one)

We rowed across the Hudson at dawn
My friend, William P. Van Ness signed on as my (number two)
Hamilton arrived with his crew
Nathaniel Pendleton and a doctor that he knew (number three)

I watched Hamilton examine the terrain
I wish I could tell you what was happening in his brain
This man has poisoned my political pursuits
Most disputes die and no one shoots (number four)

Hamilton drew first position
Looking to the world like a man on a mission
This is a soldier with a marksman's ability
The doctor turned around so he could have deniability (five)

Now I didn't know this at the time
But we were near the same spot your (my) son died, is that why? (Six)
He examined his gun with such rigor
I watched as he methodically fiddled with the trigger (seven)

Confession time, here's what I got
My fellow soldiers'll tell you I'm a terrible shot (number eight)
Your last chance to negotiate
Send in your seconds, see if they can set the record straight

They won't teach you this in your classes
But look it up, Hamilton was wearing his glasses
Why? If not to take deadly aim
It's him or me, the world will never be the same
I had only one thought before the slaughter

When I was young and dreamed of glory
You have no control
Who lives, who dies, who tells your story?

President Jefferson
I'll give him this, his financial system is a work of genius
I couldn't undo it if I tried
And I've tried

Who lives, who dies, who tells your story?

President Madison
He took our country from bankruptcy to prosperity
I hate to admit it
But he doesn't get enough credit for all the credit he gave us

Who lives, who dies, who tells your story

Every other founding fathers' story gets told
Every other founding father gets to grow old

And when you're gone, who remembers your name?
Who keeps your flame?
Who tells your story?

You claim it's not in the cards
And fate is pulling you miles away
And out of reach from me
But you're here in my heart
So who can stop me if I decide that you're my destiny?

What if we rewrite the stars?
Say you were made to be mine
Nothing could keep us apart
You'd be the one I was meant to find
It's up to you, and it's up to me

So why don't we rewrite the stars?
Maybe the world could be ours, tonight

Your fever dream, can't you see it getting closer
Just surrender 'cause you feel the feeling taking over
It's fire, it's freedom, it's flooding open
It's a preacher in the pulpit and you'll find devotion
There's something breaking at the brick of every wall
It's holding all that you know, so tell me do you wanna go?

Where the runaways are running the night

'Cause you're just a dead man walking
Thinking that's your only option
But you can flip the switch and brighten up your darkest day
Sun is up and the color's blinding
Take the world and redefine it
Leave behind your narrow mind
You'll never be the same

Go and light your light
Let it burn so bright

To the sky
And it's open wide
You're electrified

When the world becomes a fantasy
And you're more than you could ever be
