Maybe in magazines
But you'll still be my star
Baby, 'cause in the dark
You can't see shiny cars
And that's when you need me there
With you, I'll always share
Because

When the sun shine, we shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out to the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other

Used to trip off that shit I was kickin' to you
Had some fun on the run though I give it to you

But baby, don't get it twisted

Tryna fix your inner issues with a bad bitch
Didn't they tell you that I was a savage
Fuck your white horse and a carriage

Yeah, I've been thinkin' lately
That I need someone to save me

Now that I'm famous, I got hoes all around me, but
I need a good girl, I need someone to ground me, so

I need someone to share this heart with me

Man, I feel just like a rockstar (ayy, ayy)
All my brothers got that gas
And they always be smokin' like a Rasta
Fuckin' with me, call up on a Uzi
And show up, man, them the shottas
When my homies pull up on your block
They make that thing go grrra-ta-ta-ta (ta, pow, pow, pow, ayy, ayy)

Switch my whip, came back in black
I'm startin' sayin', ""Rest in peace to Bon Scott"" (Scott, ayy)
Close that door, we blowin' smoke
She ask me light a fire like I'm Morrison ('son, ayy)
Act a fool on stage
Prolly leave my fuckin' show in a cop car (car, ayy)

Threw a TV out the window of the Montage

Cocaine on the table, liquor pourin', don't give a damn

I've been fuckin' hoes and poppin' pillies
Man, I feel just like a rockstar (ayy, ayy)
All my brothers got that gas
And they always be smokin' like a Rasta
Fuckin' with me, call up on a Uzi
And show up, man, them the shottas
When my homies pull up on your block
They make that thing go grrra-ta-ta-ta (ta, pow, pow, pow, ayy, ayy)

Switch my whip, came back in black
I'm startin' sayin', ""Rest in peace to Bon Scott"" (Scott, ayy)
Close that door, we blowin' smoke
She ask me light a fire like I'm Morrison ('son, ayy)
Act a fool on stage
Prolly leave my fuckin' show in a cop car (car, ayy)
Shit was legendary
Threw a TV out the window of the Montage

Cocaine on the table, liquor pourin', don't give a damn
Dude, your girlfriend is a groupie, she just tryna get in

So the bar is where I go (mm-mm)
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast, and then we talk slow (mm-mm)
You come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me, I'll give it a chance now (mm-mm)
Take my hand, stop, put ""Van the Man"" on the jukebox
And then we start to dance
And now I'm singing like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, ""Boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me""
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead
(Mm-mm)

I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
Last night you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
Oh, I'm in love with your body

Oh I, oh I, oh I, oh I
Oh, I'm in love with your body
Oh I, oh I, oh I, oh I
Oh, I'm in love with your body
Oh I, oh I, oh I, oh I

I wanna stay up all day and all night

And when you're close up, give me the shivers
Oh, baby, you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks

That I need someone to save me

Now that I'm famous, I got hoes all around me, but

Fill you up, then run it back again

You're like a broken home to me
I take a shot of memories and black out like an empty street
I fill my days with the way you walk and fill my nights with broken dreams
I make up lies inside my head
Like, ""One day, you'll come back to me""

Now I'm not holding on, not holding on
I'm just depressed that you're gone
Not holding on, not holding on

Beautiful mistakes I make inside my head
She's naked in my bed
And now we lie awake, making beautiful mistakes
I wouldn't take 'em back
I'm in love with the past
And now we lie awake, making beautiful mistakes

Nah-nah-nah (in my head)
Nah-nah-nah (in my bed)
Nah-nah-nah (ayy)
Making beautiful mistakes

It's pitiful, I can't believe how every day gets worse for me
I take a break, I cut you off to keep myself from looking soft
I fill my nights with the way you was and still wake up with broken dreams
I make these lies inside my head
Feel like they're my reality

Where are the plans we made for two?

The people we used to be
It's even harder to picture
That you're not here next to me

You say it's too late to make it
But is it too late to try?
And in our time that you wasted
All of our bridges burned down

I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time, when we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise

Like a scene from a movie that every broken heart knows
We were walking on moonlight, and you pulled me close
Split second and you disappeared and then I was all alone
I woke up in tears with you by my side
A breath of relief, and I realized
No, we're not promised tomorrow

So I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you
I'm gonna hold you like I'm saying goodbye
Wherever we're standing, I won't take you for granted
'Cause we'll never know when, when we'll run out of time

What if we rewrite the stars?
Say you were made to be mine
Nothing could keep us apart
You'd be the one I was meant to find
It's up to you, and it's up to me
No one can say what we get to be
So why don't we rewrite the stars?
Maybe the world could be ours, tonight

Alessia Cara,2wUjUUtkb5lvLKcGKsKqsR,Scars To Your Beautiful,0wI7QkCcs8FUQE1OkXUIqd,"She just wants to be, beautiful
She goes, unnoticed she knows, no limits
She craves, attention she praises, an image
She prays to be, sculpted by the sculptor

Oh, she don't see, the light that's shining
Deeper than the eyes can find it
Maybe we have made her blind
So she tries to cover up her pain
And cut her woes away
'Cause covergirls don't cry
After their face is made

But there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful
We're stars and we're beautiful

Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh

And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful
We're stars and we're beautiful

I saw you in another's arms
Only a month we've been apart
You look happier

Saw you walk inside a bar
He said something to make you laugh
I saw that both your smiles were twice as wide as ours
Yeah, you look happier, you do

Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody love you like I do
Promise that I will not take it personal, baby

Loving can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing that I know
When it gets hard
You know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive

We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts are never broken
Time's forever frozen still

So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me closer 'til our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
Wait for me to come home

Loving can heal

Wanna know what it is, make the boys want more

Is your lover
Playing on your side?
Said he loves you
But he ain't got time
Here's the answer
Come and get it
At a knocked down price

(Hey!)

Full of honey
Just to make him sweet
Crystal balling
Just to help him see
What he's been missing
So come and get it
While you've still got time

(Hey!)

Get your boy on his knees
And repeat after me, say

Take a sip of my secret potion
I'll make you fall in love
For a spell that can't be broken
One drop should be enough
Boy, you belong to me
I got the recipe and it's called Black Magic
(And it's called Black Magic)

Take a sip of my secret potion
One taste and you'll be mine

Darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
I found a girl
Beautiful and sweet
I never knew you were the someone waitin' for me

Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowin' what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess
I whispered underneath my breath
You heard it
Darling you look perfect tonight

E enxergar as coisas que me deixam no ar
Me deixam no ar
As várias fases e estações que me levam com o vento
E o pensamento bem devagar

Outra vez, eu tive que fugir
Eu tive que correr, pra não me entregar
As loucuras que me levam até você
Me fazem esquecer que eu não posso chorar

Olhe bem no fundo dos meus olhos
E sinta a emoção que nascerá quando você me olhar

It would be such a relief if I knew that we were on the same side
Very soon I'm hoping that I...

Can marry your daughter
And make her my wife
I want her to be the only girl that I love for the rest of my life
And give her the best of me 'till the day that I die, yeah

And make her my queen

You wanna be my one and only all my life

Take me on a date, I deserve it, babe
And don't forget the flowers every anniversary

Buying groceries, buy, buying what you need

You got that 9 to 5, but baby, so do I
So don't be thinking I'll be home and bakin' apple pies
I never learned to cook, but I can write a hook

Even when I'm acting crazy
Tell me everything's alright

Every morning is the same
You walk on by my house
I wanna call out your name

I wanna tell you how beautiful you are
From where I'm standing
You got me thinkin'
What we could be 'cause

I keep craving, craving
You don't know it but it's true
Can't get my mouth to say the words
They wanna say to you

This is typical of love
Can't wait anymore
Won't wait, I need to tell you
How I feel when I see us together forever

In my dreams
You're with me
We'll be everything I want us to be
And from there, who knows?

Maybe this will be the night
That we kiss
For the first time

'Cause your shine is something like a mirror?
And I can't help but notice, you reflect in this heart of mine
If you ever feel alone and the glare makes me hard to find
Just know that I'm always parallel on the other side

'Cause with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soul
I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go
Just put your hand on the glass, I'll be tryna pull you through
You just gotta be strong

'Cause I don't wanna lose you now
I'm looking right at the other half of me
The vacancy that sat in my heart
Is a space, and now you're home
Show me how to fight for now
And I'll tell you, baby, it was easy
Coming back into you once I figured it out
You were right here all along

It's like you're my mirror (woah-oh)
My mirror staring back at me (woah-oh)
I couldn't get any bigger (woah-oh)
With anyone else beside of me (woah-oh)
And now it's clear as this promise
That were making two reflections into one
'Cause it's like you're my mirror (woah-oh)
My mirror staring back at me, staring back at me
